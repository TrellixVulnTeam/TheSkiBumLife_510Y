					My name is Jake Meyers, and I love to ski. There's nothing like waking
					up early, checking the snow report and uncontrolably smiling, knowing
					it's about to be a great day. You proceed to make a big breakfast,
					pocket some beers and snacks for later, and head to catch the bus. Get
					to the mountain with 10 minutes to spare. Grab a coffee and meet up
					with some friends giving a round of fist bumps as you guys discuss
					recent snow and where on the mountain to head first. The base is empty
					as it's 0 degrees and a Tuesday. Weekend warriors are stuck in their
					cubicle and it's too cold and early for hungover vacationers.

					Before moving to a ski town, I'd always try to find articles about the
					life that I was missing out on. Fortunatly, there wasn't much out
					there, so instead of living vicariously through a blog post, I had to
					move. I'm hoping this website helps scratch an itch, but also makes
					you consider changing your lifestyle.
